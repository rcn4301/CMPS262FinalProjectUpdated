# 🍹Shakr 🍹
> Shakr is an interactive front end application that allows users to enter the name of a cocktial and receive information on that cocktail fetched from an API. Use of CocktailDB API is intended as a time-saver and place-holder for use in proof-of-concept version until such time as made-from-scratch drink database can be created more to my liking.

## General Information
- The purpose of the project is to utilize many of the skills learned in Point Park University's CMPS262 Advanced Programming class (Jeff Seaman, Professor).
- The main goal of this project to create a useful front-end app that allows non-professionals to create high-quality cocktails simply by searching for possiblities based upon a chosen ingredient, in order to enjoy a delicious alcoholic OR non-alcoholic beverage for themselves or to provide for guests.
- By searching using an available ingredient, the user will then be given the full cocktail recipe, with ingredients, quantities, and instructions.

## Previous Sprint

Accomplished in previous sprint:
- testing of frameworks
- testing of APIs through Postman
- Integration of CocktailDB API into code
- Creation of image carousel

## Current Roadblocks

Current roadblocks: 
- Displaying of ingredients (with quantities) in search result windows
- getting the favorites button to activate by clicking on the whole button and not just the heart

## Next Sprint

Goals for next sprint:
- Add Linkage to favorites list page
- address roadblock regarding listing of ingedients in search results
- begin creating database code with which to replace testing CocktailDB API
- If possible, begin to implement additional search bars or method for searching multiple ingredients
- Continue tweaking appearance, possibly implementing additional font/design APIs
